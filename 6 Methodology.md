###### Methodology 
In the spring of 2017 I created and administered a survey which explored identity formation and amatonormative cultural engagement among adult aromantics. I sent my survey to five aromantic Tumblr blogs and asked them to spread the word. To my knowledge, Aroadventures[^1] was the only one to post my survey. I also included a link to the survey on the Mills College student news forum. Concepts in the survey included how aromatics form an aromantic identity, how they define romantic attraction and romance, and how comfortable they are with romance in various situations. The situations explored are as follows: when others demonstrate romantic feelings toward the participant, when other people discuss romance in their own lives around the participant, and when romance appears in television. I chose to focus on television because of its cultural impact and wide audience. Popular television shows permeate American culture in a way other types of media do not, and the television format lets creators dedicate large amounts of time to romance. My final question asked participants if they had anything else they wanted to share; answers to this question are spread throughout the rest of this paper as many participants used this space to elaborate on other questions.  

In terms of demographics, I asked for participants’ gender, race, and age. The age question was multiple choice—with options for 18-24, 25-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, and 60+—but all others were open ended. Ninety-six people responded to the survey. All of them provided an answer for my questions on gender and age. Three people did not indicate their race. In terms of gender, 46% of participants are women,[^2] 18% are agender, 9% are men,[^3] 7% are non binary, 5% are demigirls, 3% are genderqueer, 2% are genderfluid, 2% are androgyne, and 2% are not sure. An additional 5% is made up of five unique identities, which can be found in Appendix A. As noted above, three people did not provide their race. Of the remaining ninety-three, 81% are white, 5% are mixed race, 2% are South Asian, 2% are Mexican, and 2% are Chinese. Some people’s responses did not match up with any others; this final 6% can be found in Appendix B. Finally, 72% of participants are between eighteen and twenty-four years old, 15% between twenty-five and thirty, 10% between thirty-one and forty, 1% between fifty-one and sixty, and 2% sixty or older. No participants are between forty-one and fifty. A pie chart of this information can be found in Appendix C.

The high percentage of women and white people is notable because, if aromanticism is primarily adopted by white women, its existence could say much about how race and gender are constructed. For example, people of color have been and still are dehumanized through either hypersexualization or desexualization. Thingsthatmakeyouacey’s discusses the intersection of race, asexuality, and gender[^4] and says
> When I say it’s difficult for me to say I’m asexual, I really do mean, it is viscerally horrible to consider myself asexual. It is violent…
> Asexuality is what they want. It is what the soldiers, and the masters, and the foreign governments want. *They want us to lack something they deem human so they don’t have to empathize.* They want us to not desire because it gives them sick satisfaction. They want us not to feel because then they can justify crimes against us in our own courts.[^5]
Aromanticism can be used to dehumanize as well. The higher percentage of women might be explained by the different social expectations for men and women; women are socialized to focus on romance—to find a man and settle down—while men are less pressured to form romantic relationships. All of this is speculation, however. It is possible my survey circulated through a section of the aromantic community that contains more women and white people than the community as a whole, and so the aromantic community may or may not be predominantly white and female. More research is needed.

Aromantic asexuals make up 49% of respondents. Aromantic pansexuals make up 7%, while aromantic bisexuals make up an additional 5%. Demiromantic asexuals, aromantic heterosexuals, greyromantic asexuals, aroflux asexuals, greyromantic bisexuals, and aromantics who are either unsure of their sexual orientation or did not provide one each make up 3%. 2% of my participants are currently questioning both their sexual and romantic orientations. The final 17% includes fourteen unique identities, which can be found in Appendix D.
