###### Forming an Aromantic Identity
I received ninety-five responses to my open-ended question on when and how people realized they are aromantic. Not everyone said when they began to identify with aromanticism, but I received a variety of answers from those that did. Some people provided a particular year, others answered with a life event like high school, and a final group answered with the amount of time that has passed since their realization. Similarly, not everyone explained how they came to identify on the aromantic spectrum, although many who provided an answer went into some detail. The common threads in these responses reveal key aromantic experiences and can be used to create a more helpful definition of aromanticism. 

Forty-two people gave their age in response to the first half of my question. Two-thirds of these people were teenagers when they first identified with aromanticism; one first identified with aromanticism when they were thirteen. Two people were unclear on whether they were in their late teens or early twenties. Nine people formed their aromantic identity in their twenties, and three individuals did so in their thirties. Someone between fifty-one and sixty years old formed their aromantic identity within the last few years, and someone over sixty did so within the past few months.  

Thirty-two people responded with either a year or something like “a few years ago.” Of these, twenty-nine formed their identity within the last few years, and sixteen people first identified as aromantic within the past year. One person said five years ago, another said eight, and a final participant said they first identified as aromantic about ten years ago. Seven participants only began to identify as aromantic within the past few months. I cannot say if there was a certain year when aromanticism became more common as so many answered this question with their age and I only have a general idea of how old each person is. Based on the years provided by the thirty-two participants described above, it seems likely that more people have begun to identify with aromanticism in the past few years. This makes sense because aromanticism is relatively new and becoming more visible—giving more people the opportunity to identify as aro—but more research is needed to challenge or confirm this speculation. 

Many participants[^1] described how they felt before discovering aromanticism as an identity. Five thought everyone else exaggerated their romantic feelings. One common theme (expressed by seven individuals) was the importance of having a word to describe something already known. As one participant said, “I’ve always been aromantic, but I never knew there was a word for it…or that other people felt this way.” While this enters the essentialist territory Chasin warns against, it also exemplifies the value of the word “aromantic” to aromantic individuals and hints at another key theme: difference. Six participants felt “broken” and “distressed” before finding the aromantic community; they felt uniquely different from other people who identify with romance. One participant reported feeling like they were “missing something” and thought of themself as “‘defective,’ ‘straight by default,’ or ‘nothing.’” 

Amatonormativity creates an environment that alienates aromantics in this way, and two individuals explicitly blamed societal pressure for the length of time it took them to form an aromantic identity. As one participant said, 
> Society just pushes this amatonormative view so hard that the idea that not being romantically attracted to people was even possible didn't occur to me. At first it's just this thought of oh, I haven't fallen in love yet. But I guess I will because you have to, right? And then I kept not falling in love to the point that I wondered what was wrong with me and if I was broken. Not until I saw other people in the aro community express similar feelings did I realize that oh, this is a thing that humans can be.
This quote summarizes many major themes found in the survey responses. Before learning about aromanticism, many aromantics, myself included, assumed we would fall in love eventually.[^2] The opposite is not even an option. In response to the final question, five emphasized the importance of accurately representing aromantics in the media; this type of representation would present nonromantic relationship options and make it easier for aromantics to learn about themselves as “it’s hard to identify as something that you don't realize exists.” Another participant used the final question to say societal pressure made it hard for them “to determine what [their] true feelings are.” As discussed above, some aromantics feel broken for not feeling what everyone else is supposedly feeling. Finally, the discovery of aromanticism frequently leads to an “oh” moment. As a different participant said, it just clicks. Knowing aromanticism exists and is something many other people identify with can be a relief: “I was [not] stupid or missing out on some core part of being human…there were plenty of others who felt (or didn't feel) in ways similar to me…I no longer felt deficient.” The word “aromantic” legitimizes the feelings and experiences of aromantics. 

Six people very clearly stated a feeling of happiness or relief after discovering aromanticism; one person wrote, “I had finally found myself.” However, another participant said “it felt awful to realize” they were aromantic. They “doubted [their] humanity/personhood” and had planned their future around some assumed significant other; when they realized they were aromantic, it was like “the carpet just got pulled out from underneath [them].” Additionally, not all participants described feeling broken before learning about aromanticism. Whether or not they did experience these feelings but did not want to share is unknown. However, I personally never felt broken, most likely because I knew about aromanticism for years before finally making the connection between aromanticism and my experiences. 

Thirty-one participants explained how they first learned about aromanticism, and only three of these people made it clear that they first learned the term from people outside of the internet. Two individuals said they learned about aromanticism through the autistic community.[^3] Fourteen people mentioned Tumblr directly, and four people said they discovered aromanticism on blogs. Three people said they discovered aromanticism through the internet, one person said they used Google, and one person said they found aromanticism through social media. The remaining five participants did not provide enough information to know if they learned about aromanticism online or offline; three people said they found the term through unspecified research, and two said they discovered the term through asexuality. 

Eleven participants learned about aromanticism only after looking into other queer identities, and four mentioned identifying with aromanticism only after doing the same with asexuality. While others’ reasons for doing so are unknown, I know I identified as asexual before aromantic because I could accept not feeling sexual attraction, but the idea of not feeling romantic attraction was too overwhelming—another excellent example of amatonormativity at work.

Participants realized they are aromantic in a variety of ways. Sixteen participants made the connection after being in a romantic relationship. While dating, three people realized they were unable to return their partner’s feelings, two people felt uncomfortable, and one person felt “wrong and weird.” Thirteen people said they dislike romance, and four described being repulsed by romance, “despising every instance of romantic affection.” As an example, one participant said they were “physically sick” after being asked out. Other participants were not affected as strongly. One participant said emotional abuse “helped solidify [their] aromanticism,” and another said their aromanticism stems from a personality disorder.[^4]

Crushes were another common topic. Ten participants said they have never had a crush, three did not understand the importance other people placed on crushes, and two said they have infrequent crushes. Two said they faked crushes when asked, describing celebrities they liked but had no interest in dating. In response to the final question, one participant said they “taught [themself] how to create crushes at a young age because everyone had crushes and [they] thought that was what was expected of [them].” Another participant said,
> [A]t times, my admiration for certain celebrities could still be considered a “crush.” I know if I had a crush with someone I actually interacted with, it would be considered a romantic notion. However, my "love" for actors or athletes can never be reciprocated in the real world, so it's almost as if it is my safe space to feel a bit of romantic feeling. I guess I do the same with characters in shows occasionally as well.
This parallels what Anthony Bogaert named “autochorissexualism,” or a disconnect between an individual and a sexual target.[^5] Bogaert explains further, saying “asexual people’s fantasies often do not involve their own identities. Also, when their fantasies involve people, these individuals are unknown to the asexual person or are fictional characters; in both cases, these individuals are not directly connected to the asexual person’s real-life identity.”[^6] This is yet another area that deserves more academic exploration. 

Responses to romance varied as well. Seven said they are confused by romance in general. Two people stressed they would much rather have a platonic relationship than a romantic one, and five wrote they have no desire for a romantic relationship. Four people said they are not interested in romance. However, one person wrote that they desire romance, and another said they “think [they] want romance, and quite badly” in response to my final question. 

Twelve people wrote that they do not experience romantic attraction. Associating aromanticism with a lack of romantic attraction is helpful to an extent, but I hope to expand this definition. However, because aromanticism encompasses so much, I am wary of declaring a definition, especially given the dearth of academic research on the subject. The following, then, is an incomplete list of things aromanticism can be, based only on my survey responses. Aromanticism is an umbrella term that can be defined by a lack of romantic attraction, a disinterest in romance, romance repulsion, discomfort with romance, a lack of infatuation, confusion about romance, infrequent romantic attraction, or any combination of the experiences described above. 

[^1]:	It is hard to decide on an exact number as some people explicitly stated how they felt before learning about aromanticism, others seemed to imply that they experienced certain feelings before finding aromanticism, and others noted that they felt a certain way before discovering aromanticism but did not go into detail. I can comfortably say that at least fifteen participants provided some sort of description of how they felt before learning about aromanticism. 

[^2]:	Anagnori briefly explores this while discussing how they realized they were aromantic in their post from October 10. Additionally, three participants in the survey mentioned this directly.

[^3]:	Conflating aromanticism and autism is problematic, but so is ignoring the existence of autistic aromantics. The intersection of these two identities is another area that deserves more attention. 

[^4]:	Both of these are valid reasons to form an aromantic identity, but neither should be associated with all aromantics. Clearly not all aromantics identify with these, but some do; additionally, emotional abuse and personality disorders do not automatically make someone aromantic. The intersection of aromanticism, emotional abuse, and/or personality disorders needs to be studied further.
