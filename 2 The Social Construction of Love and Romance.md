###### The Social Construction of Love and Romance
Love and romance are social constructs. Maryan Wherry provides an introduction to the way romance controls behavior and the role it plays in American culture.[^1] According to Wherry, romantic love is a learned behavior, and there are rules that define what is acceptable romantic love. When done right, romantic love promises happiness and success. Wherry notes that much of American media replicates the idea that romance is happiness, but the significance of this is lost on many because they are so accustomed to seeing romance portrayed a certain way. In this way, love and romance “dominate and permeate”[^2] American culture. Anne E. Beall and Robert J. Sternberg support Wherry’s conclusions by arguing love is a socially constructed emotional experience.[^3] The way a culture perceives love affects how individuals in that culture experience love and controls what actions are allowed and expected in different types of relationships. 

Beall and Sternberg use historical constructions of love as evidence of the social construction of love; Susan S. Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick do the same.[^4] Beall and Sternberg note three different beliefs seen throughout Western history: that love includes sex, that love is separate from sex, and that love is an important component of marriage. Hendrick and Hendrick provide a quick introduction to four different constructions of love—including the current Western construction, which closely ties love, sex, and marriage together. Hendrick and Hendrick begin by discussing courtly love, which originated in the twelfth century. Irving Singer explores this in more depth.[^5] According to Singer, courtly love—which was not the only construction of love at the time—“affirms that love between human beings is in itself authentic and magnificent. It is love based on natural inclinations, such as sexual desire, and yet directed toward highly moral and aesthetic values.”[^6] Elements of the modern Western construction of love can be seen in courtly love; Singer describes the way courtly love believed the most successful marriages were based on reciprocated attraction and the ability of a husband and wife to get along. He also describes courtly love as a way to “[harmonize] sexual impulses with idealistic motives…justifying amorous intimacy…as an end in itself that made life worth living;”[^7] this led to later constructions of love, including our own.

Singer as well as Hendrick and Hendrick continue their exploration of love’s history by examining the Romantic Era, which began at the end of the eighteenth century. Singer says Romanticism built on the construction of courtly love; it took aspects of previous love constructs and updated them. Hendrick and Hendrick provide a quick introduction to the history of Romantic love, saying Romanticism focused on what love feels like and emphasized the powerful connection between men and women in love. According to Singer, Romantic writers expressed sexual desire in more detail than writers before them. Like past constructions, Romanticism supported marriage, but a larger focus was placed on marrying for love. In the Romantic Era, merging was “often named as the sole defining attribute of an authentic love between man and woman,”[^8] where before it was less important. Merging is the idea that lovers become one, but have also always been one. There is “a common element, an identity that defines the nature of both participants equally well.”[^9] During this time, people believed that merging also merged individuals with “the totality of everything;”[^10] in this way, love brought individuals closer to God. 

Hendrick and Hendrick briefly touch on Victorian Era constructions of love. However, Steven Seidman provides a more detailed analysis.[^11] Seidman argues Victorians believed true love was a spiritual union between two people. Sex, while a required part of marriage, was not a defining part of love. Seidman cites a survey of women from the late 1800s and early 1900s; according to the survey, women before 1900 believed sex was for reproduction, while women after 1900 saw sex as a sign of love. The historical evidence provided by Beall and Sternberg, Hendrick and Hendrick, Singer, and Seidman supports the argument that love changes across time and cultures and is therefore socially constructed. 

The aromantic community has also discussed the social construction of love and romance in detail. Kaz and The Thinking Asexual, two aromantic bloggers, both attempt to define “romantic.” Kaz writes “it’s romance if you think it’s romance”[^12] and that there are aspects of romance—“sexual interest, exclusivity, primary relationship, crush, specific types of strong emotional connection, desire for approval, etc.”[^13]—but all of those aspects can be found outside of romantic relationships and none of them are present in every single romantic relationship. The Thinking Asexual takes a similar stance, stating “the only thing that defines romantic relationships as romantic is romantic attraction… and romantic attraction is a completely subjective feeling that varies by person.”[^14] They argue nothing is inherently romantic except for romantic attraction and that all of the behaviors society views as romantic can also be found in non-romantic contexts. 

Kaz and The Thinking Asexual’s work also explore what Irrationalpoint calls “The Relationship Hierarchy:”
> [B]lood ties and marriage ties trump other sorts of ties. Sexual relationships trump non sexual relationships. You have only one partner, who shall be your sexual partner and your lawfully-wedded spouse, and no other partners, and they trump all other relationships. Marriages that produce children trump non-procreating relationships, but Thou Shalt Not Be A Single Parent. “Family” and “Friends” are distinctive sets of people, and “Family” trumps “Friends”.[^15]
American society ascribes different values to different types of relationships and views romantic relationships as somehow superior to all others. 

Kaz and Irrationalpoint wrote before the 2012 publication of Elizabeth Brake’s book and her use of the term “amatonormativity,”[^16] which has informed many of the aromantic community’s discussions about the construction of romance and the relationship hierarchy. Amatonormativity describes “the assumptions that a central, exclusive, amorous relationship is normal for humans, in that it is a universally shared goal, and that such a relationship is normative, in that it *should* be aimed at in preference to other relationship types.”[^17] An amatonormative society “prompts the sacrifice of other relationships to romantic love and marriage and relegates friendship and solitudinousness to cultural invisibility.”[^18] 

Kaz describes their frustration with amatonormativity without using the term; they dislike having to categorize their relationships as either romantic or non-romantic—as either something that feels incorrect or something society views as less valuable. When people say they are just friends, they devalue friendship; Kaz argues “that friendship doesn’t have to be ‘just’, and that there are more options than friendship or romance.”[^19] The Thinking Asexual directly connects their ideas to amatonormativity, arguing against “internalized amatonormativity and romance supremacy”[^20] in the aromantic community. According to The Thinking Asexual, amatonormativity can only exist as long as aromanticism is invisible; interrogating romance and exploring aromanticism will destabilize amatonormativity. This is similar to arguments made by scholars exploring asexuality. (See the asexuality section below.) 

Amatonormativity assumes romantic attraction is universal, but aromantics, or “aros,” do not, or only occasionally, experience romantic attraction. In this way, aromanticism is the ultimate challenge to amatonormativity; it requires us to rethink the entire concept of romance. If there are people who do not experience romantic attraction, then romantic attraction cannot be universal. If love, affection, lifelong partnership, sex, intimacy, touch, support, etc can be found outside of romantic relationships, then those things cannot define romance. While Brake and amatonormativity are just one example of the way the aromantic community engages with and expands upon scholarly work, they are a key part of aromantic discussion about romance, attraction, and social constructions. A minority of survey participants discussed topics like these with ease, and one mentioned Brake directly.

The results of my survey echo scholarly and community discussions in other ways as well. When asked to define “romantic attraction” and “romance,” participants in my survey listed examples of behaviors associated with romance like cuddling, holding hands, kissing, sharing a bed, and hugging. Dominant American society assumes these actions are romantic; in doing so, it assumes some types of affection can only be found in romantic relationships. However, all of these occur outside of a romantic context. Friends cuddle. Parents hold their children’s hands. People kiss without romantic intentions. Siblings share beds. Family and friends hug. As one survey participant said, 
> I believe a major problem in defining romantic orientation is the idea that there is a platonic/romantic binary, that those are the only two options people have. I have a very close and beloved friend that I sometimes imagine spending the rest of my life with, but I wouldn't qualify these feelings as strictly romantic nor strictly platonic and I think a lot of discussions about orientations and attractions suffer from the lack of nuanced terminology specifically for platonic and romantic feelings, or a mixture thereof.
There is no solid, unmoving line between romantic and platonic; they make up a spectrum. The relationship hierarchy and amatonormativity force platonic and romantic into two discrete categories and create the illusion that romance is the only source of certain interactions in order to construct romantic relationships as superior.
