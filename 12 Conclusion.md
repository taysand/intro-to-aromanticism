######Conclusion 
Aromanticism embodies many things including, but not at all limited to, not experiencing romantic attraction, a disinterest in romance, romance repulsion, being confused by romance, and rarely experiencing romantic attraction. Looking at aromanticism as a whole, it is easy to say that it represents a separation from romance, but this ignores the complexity of aromantic experiences. The simple, easy definition of “aromantic” is “someone who does not experience romantic attraction,” while a more accurate definition could fill a book. The concept of aromanticism challenges the idea that romance is universal, and so it seems especially ironic to claim there is some sort of universal aromantic experience. 

When talking about aromanticism, it is important to have a solid understanding of what romance is. Our concept of romance is heavily influenced by our society. Because of this, the right type of romance (i.e. heterosexual, cis, white, able bodied, etc) is valued above familial and platonic relationships; people are expected to form romantic relationships that conform to this ideal as closely as possible. Certain actions are constructed as inherently romantic, but their actual romantic implications depend on the intent and emotions of the people involved. 

Aromantics navigate our amatonormative society in a variety of ways, which sometimes contradict each other because different aromantics have very different feelings about romance. Some are repulsed by romance and try to avoid it; others embrace it. One common strategy is to deconstruct romance and challenge amatonormativity. Aromanticism counters social constructions of romance and offers a unique perspective. Aromanticism exists, and it has the potential to completely change how we think about romance, relationships, and human nature.
