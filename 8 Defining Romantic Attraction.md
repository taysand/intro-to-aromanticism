###### Defining Romantic Attraction
When asked to define “romantic attraction,” twenty-eight people indicated some sort of uncertainty through either extensive use of question marks (“A different kind of love???”) or direct statements (“Buddy, I don't even know.”). This type of response was the most common—perhaps because, as one participant put it, “it's like trying to define something you can't see or touch, by looking at how other people act when they're acting in ways that make no sense.” Despite this general confusion, I received ninety-two answers to this open-ended question. As I suspected, aromantics have some idea of what romantic attraction is, as this is what we currently define ourselves against. These responses construct a broad definition of romantic attraction. 

Twenty-six people defined “romantic attraction” as wanting romantic gestures from someone, and twenty-five said romantic attraction is wanting a romantic relationship with someone; these two groups overlap as seven people mentioned wanting romantic gestures *and* romantic relationships. Participants provided examples of romantic gestures: “cuddling,” “hugging,” “kissing,” “holding hands,” “staring into each other’s eyes,” “going on dates,” and “giving gifts like flowers.” These answers match the definition provided by blogs like Anagnori and Arospecawarenessweek and lead to the same questions: What makes gestures and a relationship romantic? Romantic attraction. What defines romantic attraction? Wanting romantic gestures, and so on. Five participants noted the social construction of romance; one said romantic attraction is “[a]n attraction to someone that elicits a desire to seek and express intimacy with that someone according to culturally constructed conventions of romantic love.” Another participant combined social constructions with individual preference, saying romantic attraction is the “[d]esire for interactions with another person that are understood and accepted as characterizing a romantic relationship, whether by your culture in general, or you specifically as an individual reflecting on your own interpersonal style.” 

Thirteen people said romantic attraction and relationships are “something more” than other types of attraction and relationships. Romantic attraction was described as more sensual and intense than friendship, and six made a point to separate it from sexual attraction and desire. One person said romantic relationships have a certain “specialness” that platonic ones do not; another said romantic attraction is “on a different level.” At the same time, six participants separated romantic attraction and relationships from other types but did not assign more value to one or the other; one called it “a different kind of love.” Two participants had trouble distinguishing romantic attraction from friendship, defining it as similar to friendship. One participant brought up “queerplatonic relationships,” or those that blur the line between platonic and romantic, but are not romantic. 

People used a variety of other words and concepts to define romantic attraction. One participant described it as “that undeniable pull toward someone in a way that sometimes even defies reason.” Nine people connected romantic attraction to romantic love or falling in love, nine noted the importance of physical affection, six brought up intimacy, four described some sort of closeness between individuals, four believe an emotional connection is important, and two listed emotional support as a key component. Six people believe wanting to be around someone—two participants specified that this want should be for an extended period of time—was one indication of romantic attraction. Seven connected romantic attraction to exclusivity, two brought up marriage, and one said wanting to share your life with someone else is an indication of romantic attraction. Four people mentioned crushes. Other answers include “preoccupation” with someone (indicated by four participants), happiness (three), passion (two), knowing someone (two), longing (one), care (one), and “a warm feeling inside your heart” (one). Many of these also came up when participants defined romance.

Based on these responses, romantic attraction is the desire to perform certain actions that have been socially constructed as romantic with a specific person, but it is also a desire for other actions that have romantic potential. I discuss this idea more in the next section. People experiencing romantic attraction often want to form a romantic relationship with another person; this includes spending time with, getting to know, being known by, being emotionally or physically intimate with, and thinking about that person. Ultimately, romantic attraction is a desire for romance, but what is romance?
