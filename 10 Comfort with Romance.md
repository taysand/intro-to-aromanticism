######Comfort with Romance
I asked my participants three questions relating to their comfort with romance when it is directed at them, discussed around them, or shown on television. Each question asked participants to place their comfort level on a scale of one to five, from not at all comfortable to very comfortable. Space was provided for them to elaborate if they felt the need. I received ninety-six responses for each scale question, seventy-two elaborations for romance directed at the participants, seventy-one for discussions of romance, and eighty for romance in television. In general, people were more uncomfortable with romance directed at them than they were with the other two situations; forty-three indicated they are not at all uncomfortable with romance when it is directed at them, compared to only seven “not at all”s for romance discussed around them and five for romance in television. Conversely, only two people marked that they are very comfortable with romance directed at them, while nineteen did the same for the discussion of romance and eight for romance in television. The most common answer to my questions on the discussion of romance and romance in television was a three on the comfort scale. Responses to all three questions included mentions of romance repulsion. Graphs of these results can be found in Appendix E.

Two main trends appear in the responses to my question about romance directed at participants. Eight people felt bad for having to turn the person down; three people said they felt guilty for hurting the other person’s feelings and not being able to reciprocate. Fourteen participants also felt that the situation was made uncomfortable or awkward because they do not reciprocate those romantic feelings: “[I] have to reject them since I can't reciprocate and then I feel like I've harmed them just by existing. So I feel guilt for hurting them, and shame that I can't be normal like they want, and pity that they have to endure romantic feelings.” While no one else mentioned feeling pity—a word whose use brings up its own set of questions that I cannot answer here—the rest of this response captures feelings expressed by other participants. 

Eight differentiated having a friend confess romantic feelings versus a stranger. For six participants, a friend’s confession is worse than a stranger’s because it threatens their relationship. Only two feel more comfortable with a friend because they trust their friends and believe their wishes will be respected. Six people stressed the importance of having their choices respected; they feel much more comfortable when whoever has feelings for them understands, respects their boundaries, and accepts that a romantic relationship will not happen.

Forty-three people, almost half of those surveyed, marked that they are “not at all” comfortable with romantic feelings being directed at them. Three people said they are romance repulsed in this situation. Twenty-nine people said they are “uncomfortable”—not surprising as I used this word in the question. Other words used to describe this feeling of discomfort  include “awkward” (indicated by seven participants), “confused” (three), “stressed” (two), “embarrassed” (two), “horrifying” (two), “anxious” (two), “threatened” (two), “panic” (two), “unease” (two), “disappointed” (one), “disgusted” (one), “icky” (one), “self conscious” (one), “horrible” (one), “annoyed” (one), “afraid” (one), “dread and worry” (one), and “incomprehensible” (one). One person said they “would rather be set on fire than have people hit on or try to date” them. Four people noted that they do not know how to react, leading to discomfort. One person said declarations of romantic feelings can make them question their own feelings. Finally, someone explained they felt “almost ill” after people expressed romantic feelings toward them.

Six people answered with a four, while two answered with five (very comfortable). In the elaboration section, six people said they are flattered by romantic feelings directed at them. One participant said the initial attention is flattering, but is overshadowed by the pressure of expectations. Two others also commented on being unable to meet expectations. One person said they love it, another said it feels great, and a third said they desire it. Four people said they have a hard time recognizing romantic attention in the first place. Clearly, there is no universal aromantic reaction to being asked out.

In general, people are more comfortable with others talking about their own romantic lives. Nine said they are happy for the people in healthy romantic relationships. Hearing friends talk about their romantic lives makes ten participants happy because they enjoy learning about their friends’ lives; four of these participants said they are also rather good at giving relationship advice. Four people said this situation is more comfortable because they are not directly involved with the romance, and nine find it enjoyable. One person said they “adore romance, just not when it's aimed at” them. Ten do not mind either way, and another ten said they think it is “fine,” “bearable,” or “okay.” Twenty-three participants said their comfort level depends on different factors like how they feel that day (indicated by four participants) and who is talking about romance (indicated by four). Four people become less comfortable the more detailed the discussion is; another four dislike when romance is the only topic of conversation. Similarly, four said conversations about romance are fine as long as there is no sense of romance superiority: “So long as they do not insist that romance is necessary/superior…it's fine.” Two people said they are fine with conversations about romance as long as no one asks them for advice. 

Twenty-four participants rated their comfort level with this type of romance at the low end of the scale, indicating they are not at all comfortable; seven participants selected one and seventeen chose two. Many of the words and feelings used in the elaboration section match with what participants said for the question about romance directed at them; six people said romance not directed at them is “boring,” five said it is “confusing,” four said it is “annoying,” two said it is not interesting, one said it is “awkward,” one said it is gross, and one said it is disappointing. Three people said adjacent romance makes them feel repulsed, two people said “nervous,” two said “sad,” and one said it makes them feel afraid. Two people said they “hate” hearing about or seeing other people’s romantic lives. 

Negative answers to this question differ from answers to the previous question in a few ways. Four people said they feel “alienated,” “excluded,” or isolated by conversations about romance. Three people said they dislike how these conversations remind them that they are missing out on something; as one participant said, they “find it odd and uncomfortable when others discuss their romantic lives, and [they] feel like an alien outsider observing a foreign species that [they] cannot connect with and cannot understand. It makes [them] feel robotic; cold and empty as [they]  feel nothing yet others have a whole world that [the participant]  cannot hope to tap into.” Nine also described being unable to relate. PDA makes four participants uncomfortable or repulsed. Finally, three people stated they do not care for all the drama involved in these types of conversations.

The distribution of answers to my question about romance in television is very similar to that of discussion of other people’s romantic lives. Additionally, negative responses to romance in television paralleled the reactions to the previous situations. Some participants feel “bored” (6 participants), “annoyed” (3), “awkward” (2), and disappointed (1) by romance in television; others described television romance as unrelatable (5), “unrealistic” (2), “not very interesting” (2), “weird” (1), “pointless” (1), “dumb” (1), “fake” (1), “cringy and awful” (1), “trite” (1), or unnatural (1). One person said they hate it, and another said they are repulsed by it. One participant said they are “a lot more uncomfortable with fictional romance than real-life romance…because we're forced to watch the intimate details for an extended amount of time when it's fictional.” Another said “[i]t feels intrusive and inappropriate to watch romance on TV.” Romance in television also makes one person feel as though they are missing out on “a great wonder of human experience.” Finally, seven participants expressed their dismay over PDA and explicit sexuality on screen.

A majority of responders (sixty-seven) marked their comfort level as three or higher. Nine said they enjoy romance in television, while forty-eight said they *sometimes* enjoy it depending on a few factors. In response to the final question, one participant said they like romance in fiction because it helps them understand it. Thirty people said they are fine with romance if it is well written—meaning the relationship is healthy, believable, convincing, makes sense, and is not forced or abusive. Thirteen people complained about how heteronormative television is, and five specified that these relationships tend to be toxic or forced. Seven expressed greater interest in queer romance. In fact, when queer relationships were mentioned, they were mentioned positively, but straight relationships were only brought up to highlight elements of television romance people would like to see change. Six people said they do not like romance in television when it is forced, but did not specify between straight or queer romances. In their response to the final question, one participant said they “would care less about badly written romance if [they] weren't aware that it's often used because writers believe romance is necessary to include to the point of needing to force it in.” Twelve people emphasized the importance of portraying healthy romances on television and expressed their dislike of toxic or abusive romances. One person answered the final question by saying their comfort with romance on television depends on the day, their mood, and “how many romantic images [they] see in a period of time.”

The way romance is displayed on television—beyond being well written and healthy—also affects how comfortable people are. Some said they need to be convinced:
>Because I don't know what a crush feels like, I have a hard time believing two characters can be head-over-heels, madly in love at first sight with each other without a solid friendship first. If I can't easily explain why two characters are 'in love' with each other (just simply stating 'she's pretty'/'he's funny' doesn't count), then I don't enjoy watching that relationship. What are their shared hobbies, life experiences, passions, etc? What do they respect about each other as a person? Tell me definitively what these two characters like about each other, and then I will believe they are in a healthy romantic relationship if the piece of media claims it as one.
A basis in friendship is important to four individuals, and subtle, “softer” romantic displays like “hand holding, cheek touching, forehead presses” are preferred by two. One person used the final question to say this type of “‘soft core’ romance” makes them more comfortable because it “appears relatively platonic in nature” and is not “overtly romantic.” 

Many participants complained about aspects of romance in television that are clear examples of amatonormativity at work. Three participants dislike it when romance dominates or derails plots and characterization. Eight participants prefer romance as a subplot, eight expressed displeasure over television shows that are too dependent on romance, eight dislike shows with unnecessary romance, and three dislike ones that use romance for drama and little else; as one participant said in their response to the final question, they are “sick to death of romance being such a major part of most shows.” Four wished for more shows without romance. Eleven people also dislike the way “media emphasizes romantic relationships as the be-all-end-all to success and happiness in life.” One person said romance is often “incorporated quite lazily.” Romance is overused in television shows because romance is considered a universal human experience and valued over other relationship types. Poorly written romance can also be blamed on amatonormativity (and heteronormativity, racism, ableism, etc) because, as one participant said, "two young, conventionally attractive, usually white people are in the same room for more than 30 seconds, clearly they [must] be attracted to each other!" and so the writers put less effort into developing what they believe is already obvious. Finally, television and other media treat romantic relationships as the ultimate achievement; this is amatonormative. 

Much of people’s discomfort with romance in television, then, seems to come from aggressive amatonormativity and the social construction of romance, not from the romantic intentions displayed on screen. For example, one participant said the fact “people who seem not to like each other are considered good romantic partners” makes them uncomfortable. Participants called out the romanticization of abusive relationships and the reliance on amatonormative/heteronormative assumptions about men, women, and romance to convince audiences that a relationship is romantic; these problems stem from current social constructions of romance. While this perspective is certainly not universal, it is interesting to consider. Of course, some participants are made uncomfortable by romance no matter how secondary or well written it is.
