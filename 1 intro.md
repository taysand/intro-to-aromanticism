# Introduction to Aromanticism and Related Concepts
Romance is a staple of American society and saturates our media. We are taught that all humans desire romance, and that romance itself is the ultimate achievement. Because of this, romantic relationships are valued over others, and people are expected to form long-lasting, committed romantic relationships. The pressure to find romance and the socially acceptable practice of ignoring others in favor of a significant other hurts individuals, families, and friendships. However, it is especially problematic for a growing number of people who identify as aromantic, or someone who does not experience romantic attraction. The aromantic community—for this paper, anyone who associates themselves with this group and especially those who post about their aromanticism online—has spent at least seven years[^1] deconstructing dominant ideas about romance, but academia has taken little notice. This paper acts as an introduction to aromanticism and an argument for its inclusion in scholarly discussions. In it, I will address four main questions: What is aromanticism? What is romance? How do aromantics feel about and interact with our romance-obsessed society? And finally, how can aromanticism be used to deconstruct romance, challenge heteronormativity, and rethink current theories about love, attraction, and the necessity of romance? 

I begin with an introduction to the social construction of romance and the split attraction model, including asexuality. In the next section, I consider the problems with popular definitions of aromanticism and romantic attraction. The rest of the paper discusses responses to my survey on aromanticism and romance in American television. I conclude by considering aromanticism’s radical potential.

[^1]:	Cakeatthefortress, "A Mystery that is the A-Romantic Community History.” Cakeatthefortress believes the word “aromantic” first appeared in the asexual community around 2004, but the aromantic community did not become its own group until 2010, when the National Coalition for Aromantic Visibility was formed. This website is no longer available. I was not part of the early formation of this community, and so I do not know exactly when the conversations I am addressing became popular in the aromantic community. It seems likely that people would have asked the same questions I am asking now in the six years between the first use of the word and the initial separation from asexuality. In any case, by the time the aromantic community became its own entity in 2010, it is highly likely that these sorts of conversations were taking place.
