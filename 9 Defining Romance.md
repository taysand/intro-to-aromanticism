###### Defining Romance
Eighty-nine people defined romance, and many of these definitions overlapped with those given for romantic attraction. A few people simply directed me to their previous answer, although one person said romance is “the act as opposed to the desire.” This question was also open ended. There were more discussions of the social construction of romance in these responses than there were for romantic attraction and only eighteen indications of uncertainty.

Eleven participants called romance a social construct in one way or another, and ten people described “romance” as a performance or set of practices “with culturally understood meanings, narratives…and so on around romantic love and its institutions.” Four people noted that their main source of information on romance is the media, and two explicitly acknowledged that the media is not an accurate source.

Seventeen participants defined “romance” as loving someone, and seventeen connected romance to displays of affection, need, or devotion. Twelve people brought up intimacy. Physical affection (indicated by seven participants), starting a life together or otherwise “intertwining…your lives” (eight), dating (seven), and unconditional love (two) were also common responses. Two people separated romance from sex. One person wrote that romance is “[b]eing alone with one person and completely content with just their company.” Other descriptions include a very emotional connection (indicated by eight participants), emotional and physical closeness (five), some sort of desire (five), “caring” (three), “commitment” (two), exclusivity (two), “yearning” (one), “thoughtfulness” (one), respect (one), and selflessness (one). Six participants defined romance as partnership. 

Romance was, not surprisingly, compared to friendship. Six people were unsure of the difference between the two: “I think it is a lot like being friends, but you want to spend a lot of time with the other person and do nice things for them, but I do have this with friends and I have no idea why it's different from being friends.” Or, as someone else tentatively said, romance is “[l]ike a friendship but just with kisses?” Six said romance goes beyond friendship, but one person described it as “[a] relationship that's different from friendship but also just as meaningful.” This definition compares romance and friendship and finds them both equally valuable. 

The surest way to draw a line between romance and friendship is to define romance, as one participant said, on intent. Four participants said “romance” is defined by “whatever the people involved in a romance consider to be romantic;” romance is different for different people. One noted that romance involves the desire to be viewed as a couple, another said romance is “the actions taken to express one’s attraction to another,” and a third participant described romance as a way to show someone “how you feel about them.” As discussed above, actions socially constructed as romantic are not indicative of romance. Performing actions socially constructed as romantic while intending those actions to be romantic makes those actions romantic. Additionally, performing actions socially constructed as romantic without any romantic intentions does not necessarily make those actions romantic. Finally, performing actions that are not socially constructed as romantic, but intending those actions to be romantic makes those actions romantic. Raptor explains this well: 
> Let’s say two people arrive on my doorstep. One of them has a bouquet of expensive roses from the florist. The other one has a dead bird in a plastic bag. We all know which one is to be considered the romantic gift (hint: it’s not the corpse) 
> And it’s not like I don’t like flowers or am allergic or anything, I would probably be flattered. But I have no connection to roses, and like, you can give roses to more or less anyone
> Dead birds are not a standard gift, for pretty obvious reasons. A person bringing me a corpse in a plastic bag had to know me well enough to know that I collect bones and process them myself, and you don’t go shopping for birds in the Dead Bird Shop around the corner, so that means this person didn’t go out with the intent of getting me something and came back with an Appropriate Gift, they probably stumbled across something and thought about me (this ‘something’ just so happens to be a dead bird, because I’m weird) And then they had to go through the process of picking this bird up and bagging it and bringing it to me, probably pretty spontaneously and without a calendar event that says Find Dead Bird For Raptor with a time slot between three and four pm.
> You can’t have Corpse I Found In a Ditch be romantic without some sort of connection here. Roses can be romantic, but it can also just, be a formula. Two plus Two Equals Romance. A shortcut for ‘I care about you,’ even though the person might …. not, actually.[^1]
Raptor wrote this in response to Stella’s discussion[^2] of what is and is not romantic. Stella, like some of my survey participants, believes emotion is another key element of romance. Considering the emotion and intent behind actions and relationships makes it much easier to draw the line between friendship and romance, when a line can be drawn. Romantic attraction plays a key role in making emotions and intentions romantic, so romance can be thought of as romantic emotions and intentions that are influenced by romantic attraction and societal constructs.
