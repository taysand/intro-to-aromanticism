###### Beginning to Define Aromanticism, Romance, and Romantic Attraction
Academic discussion about aromanticism is virtually nonexistent. Scholarly work on asexuality often mentions aromanticism in a few sentences to show the diversity of experiences in the asexual community, but this is far from the amount of attention aromanticism deserves. In summarizing past work on asexuality, Carrigan, Gupta, and Morrison indirectly refer to aromanticism in their discussion of K. S. Scherrer’s work,[^1] writing “some of her respondents were not interested in forming romantic relationships.”[^2] Chasin uses the word “aromantic,” but only to say that aromantics exist, do not experience romantic attraction, and produce “unique subcultural products”[^3] like memes—not exactly a detailed analysis. Asexuality itself is a relatively new topic in academia, and the work being done by these scholars is vitally important, but aromanticism is more than a footnote to asexuality. 

A vast majority of the work on aromanticism takes place in and is aimed at the aromantic community, but there are a few exceptions. For example, Julie Sondra Decker’s book contains the longest discussion of aromanticism I have seen outside the online community.[^4] The section on aromanticism is simple and meant to provide a basic introduction to those unfamiliar with either asexuality or aromanticism, but it is noteworthy all the same as Decker clearly defines terms and concepts. To Decker, romance is signified when individuals “cross a certain threshold of intimacy and access to each other’s lives.”[^5] This explanation, like the rest of Decker’s piece on aromanticism, is a helpful starting point, but lacks nuance. Like the scholars above, Decker focuses on asexuality.

The aromantic community has produced many posts acting as an introduction to aromanticism and related ideas. Anagnori and Arospecawarenessweek both created glossaries by and for the aromantic community.[^6] The variety and changing nature of the identities and concepts found on these pages hint at the more in-depth conversations happening in the community. Arospecawarenessweek also provides a more detailed and personal introduction that summarizes the basic idea of aromanticism and addresses the broken feeling experienced by many aromantics before they find community.[^7] When I was questioning my romantic orientation, Anagnori’s “You Might Be Aromantic If…”[^8] was the most helpful resource I found because it lists tangible feelings and experiences common to aromantics; “[y]ou’re not sure if you’ve ever had a crush on someone or fallen in love”[^9] is much easier to relate to than a glossary definition of aromantic—“A person who does not experience romantic attraction.”[^10] “You Might Be Aromantic If…” provides concrete examples instead of forcing the reader to understand romantic attraction in the first place and recognize whether or not they experience it.

The most common definition of aromanticism relies on the concept of romantic attraction, but attempts to define romantic attraction easily lead into circular thinking. The community is aware of this problem and is working toward solidifying these relatively new concepts and terms. Anagnori defines “romantic attraction” as “[a] feeling of attraction, desire or strong interest” which “often takes the form of crushes, infatuation or falling in love.”[^11] Arospecawarenessweek defines it as “romantic feelings or desires toward someone” and “wishing to do romantic activities with them.”[^12] However, if romantic attraction is “romantic feelings” or “wishing to do romantic activities,” then what makes something romantic? According to The Thinking Asexual, the only thing that makes something romantic is romantic attraction. If this is true, then romantic attraction is defined by romance which is defined by romantic attraction. When I attempt to define romantic attraction, I find myself resorting to popular romantic tropes: romantic attraction is long walks on the beach, watching the sunset, kissing in the rain, listening to a love song and thinking about someone specific, butterflies, flowers, dating, marriage, holding hands, staying up all night talking, knowing somebody, needing somebody. None of these definitions are particularly helpful as these activities, feelings, and ideas do not necessarily indicate romantic attraction. 

Arospecawarenessweek says, “This is a community of people who largely do not understand romantic attraction so this is the worst place to turn to for a sound definition.”[^13] This is valid and brings up one of the problems with simple definitions of aromanticism: How does someone realize they do not experience something when they do not know what they are not experiencing? At the same time, aromantics must have some idea of what romantic attraction is—how else would we define ourselves against it? My own, personal definition of “romantic attraction” is fuzzy; it is a feeling that I have only heard vague or poetic descriptions of—something I cannot quite conceptualize. However, when I say I am not romantically attracted to any gender, I mean something specific. I do not want to date anyone or hold hands or cuddle or share a house or get married or do other stereotypically romantic things; I have never had a crush. These examples suggest aromanticism signals a disinterest in things associated with romance, but of course my experience does not represent that of all aromantics. What do other aromantics imagine when they say they do not experience romantic attraction? What unites us all under this umbrella identity? What is romantic attraction? What is romance? Most importantly, what is aromanticism?
