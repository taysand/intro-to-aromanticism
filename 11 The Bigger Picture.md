######The Bigger Picture
It is clear that individual aromantics think about, interact with, and handle romance differently. This is not surprising. However, one common strategy, both in my survey responses and in the community as a whole, is to analyze and critique the social construction of romance, the relationship hierarchy, and the way romance is portrayed in television (and other forms of media). In doing so, we can begin to dismantle amatonormativity and the relationship hierarchy, as well as heteronormativity.

Amatonormativity constructs a relationship hierarchy as described by Irrationalpoint and discussed by Kaz. Survey participants noted many of the ways the relationship hierarchy harms aromantic individuals specifically. Two participants addressed it directly in their answers to the final question; one said “we as a society shouldn’t prioritize romantic relationships over other types of love like friends and family,” while the other mentioned “phrases like ‘friendship that GRADUATES into romance’ [and] ‘could so & so be something MORE?’ [that imply] platonic friendships are less than romantic ones.” One participant said they feel sad when other people talk about romance because this participant believes their friends “don’t think [their] friendship is as important as the [romantic] relationship.” Another participant said their “friends are rapidly becoming distant acquaintances as their friendships become less important than their domestic lives.” A final participant said they wish “people understood that romance isn't more precious than friendship” and wonder why “people tend to think that it's okay to drop your friend when you have a datefriend.” The idea that the truest relationships are romantic and that all other relationships are lacking in some way harms aromantics (and others) by suggesting—and in some ways requiring—our friends care about their significant others more than us, but also by creating the idea that romance is the ultimate—and for aromantics, unachievable—goal. The relationship hierarchy says that romance is the pinnacle of human happiness, yet many aromantics will never experience it; this is alienating and demoralizing. Participants criticized the relationship hierarchy in their responses; four people did so in their answers to the question on others’ romantic lives, and eleven did so in their answers to the question on romance in television. Acknowledging the damage done by the relationship hierarchy is a key step to dismantling amatonormativity and heteronormativity.

Amatonormativity and heteronormativity are closely related. Heteronormativity says men must date women—a romantic relationship is required. The amatonormative aspect of heteronormativity is part of what makes LGBT people form straight romantic relationships, because the pressure to participate in a (correct) romantic relationship is immense. These relationships must be heterosexual because we live in a heteronormative society. Finally, amatonormativity pushes people into romantic relationships they might not want and asks them to ignore the other important relationships in their lives; this can lead to abusive relationships. Many, many scholars, activists, and others have written about heteronormativity, but amatonormativity has received less attention. This is unfortunate because by deconstructing amatonormativity, we challenge heteronormativity as well. 

The existence of aromanticism proves romance is not a universal human experience or goal. Romance is not a requirement for being happy or human. Other relationships, like friendship, can be just as important and fulfilling as romance; that is to say, romance is not superior. Finally, gestures and actions cannot be inherently romantic. All of these statements challenge heteronormativity. Men and women are expected to fall in love, get married, and have children, and it is assumed that everyone wants these things because wanting these things is what makes us normal humans. Those not in a (straight) relationship are presumably sad and miserable, even if they think they are happy—imagine the plot of any romcom. Once someone has entered a straight relationship, they are expected to separate themselves from their family in order to start their own; friendships are also relegated to the side so the new couple can focus on themselves. Additionally, because romantic love is the ultimate everything, friends are unnecessary. Heteronormativity also interprets certain actions as inherently romantic when performed between males and females; if a young boy and girl interact, it is assumed they like each other. If a man and a woman spend time alone together, they must be dating. 

It is important to consider amatonormativity when discussing heteronormativity. Replacing the current system with one that accepts queer romantic relationships but still requires some form of romantic relationship only solves part of the problem. Aromantics have made impressive progress toward deconstructing romance, rethinking relationships, and challenging amatonormativity, but there are many questions that remain unanswered. Instead of attempting to list all of these, I will recap some of the questions I asked previously: Is romantic attraction oriented toward gender, like the split attraction model suggests, or is it unaffected by gender, like Diamond writes? Is the aromantic community predominantly white and female, like my survey results suggest? Is there a specific year when aromanticism began to take off? What can we learn from “autochorisromanticism,” or identity-less romanticism? How do stereotypes about mental health, emotional abuse, and aromanticism interact? How do those interactions affect aromantics and non-aromantics? One participant said they feel “pity” for those that “have to endure romantic feelings,” but is this a common notion among aromantics? Answering these questions and continuing to discuss aromanticism has the potential to dismantle amatonormativity and heteronormativity.
