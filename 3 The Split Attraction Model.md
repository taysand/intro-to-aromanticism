###### The Split Attraction Model
In order to differentiate between aromanticism and asexuality (not feeling sexual attraction), the aromantic and asexual communities created the split attraction model. This model primarily focuses on sexual and romantic attraction, although there are discussions surrounding other types of attraction as well. For example, Anagnori lists platonic, aesthetic, and sensual attraction in their glossary.[^1] The split attraction model lets asexuals and aromantics better define their experiences. While it is also used by non-asexuals and non-aromantics, there is a heated debate online—as seen in posts by bloggers like Lezgem[^2] and Socialjusticeorwhatever[^3]—about the potential problems that come from constructing sexualities as only sexual. However, as Socialjusticeorwhatever notes, the split attraction model was created by asexuals and aromantics to better understand their experiences, and so it is noteworthy despite its shortcomings. For many people, sexual attraction and romantic attraction are aligned; this is less common for asexuals and aromantics. Some asexuals are aromantic, but there are asexuals who experience romantic attraction and aromantics who experience sexual attraction. The split attraction model is used to capture these different experiences. 

Lisa M. Diamond’s work provides biological support for the split attraction model.[^4] According to Diamond, sexual attraction evolved for reproduction while romantic love originated from a pair-bonding system designed to keep individuals together long enough to protect and raise a child. Because these evolved for different reasons, humans are capable of falling in love without experiencing sexual desire or experiencing sexual desire without falling in love. Interestingly, Diamond believes romantic love is not oriented toward any gender—meaning anyone can fall in love with anyone at anytime. This slightly contradicts the split attraction model, which describes both sexual and romantic attraction as oriented toward specific genders. While American society currently associates romance with sex, Diamond believes romantic love and sexual desire are two unique concepts. 

Before exploring sexual and romantic attraction in more detail, I would like to briefly address platonic, aesthetic, and sensual attraction to show the split attraction model’s complexity. Platonic attraction is the “[d]esire for friendship or another close non-romantic relationship with someone.”[^5] A platonic crush is known as a “squish.” Aesthetic attraction refers to the desire to look at someone because you like their appearance, which may or may not be associated with sexual or romantic attraction; admiring someone beautiful without wanting to sleep with or date them is aesthetic attraction. Sensual attraction is a desire for physical touch and closeness; like aesthetic attraction, sensual attraction can also exist without a sexual or romantic component.[^6]

The major significance of the split attraction model is its ability to separate romantic and sexual attraction. According to the asexual and aromantic communities, sexual attraction is the desire to do sexual acts with someone. Being able to distinguish between these two types of attraction is key because, while some people experience sexual and romantic attraction in a way that makes them seem identical, others do not. Sexual attraction is conflated with romantic attraction, but they are not necessarily the same thing. Additionally, sex is not romance, and romance is not sex. This distinction is important to remember.[^7]

Anagnori chose to include only asexuality in the title of this post, but “include[s] words from aromantic discourse because of the overlap between the two communities.”
